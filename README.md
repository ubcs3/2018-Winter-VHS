## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar brings together students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC to develop software skills for science.

### Winter 2018 Video Hangout Series

Let's hangout over lunch and learn about new technologies by watching video tutorials! Our meetings are casual and allow us to explore a *wide* range of software topics from data visualization with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to web development with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to big data processing with [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/). *Everyone is invited!*

Please suggest a video in the ["Suggest a Video!" issue](https://github.com/ubcs3/2018-Winter-VHS/issues/1). Our video hangout series meets every **Wednesday 1-2pm in LSK 121**. Please join the [UBCS3 mailing list](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VCa1EYL5xjlUQ5) to receive weekly updates about the seminar.
